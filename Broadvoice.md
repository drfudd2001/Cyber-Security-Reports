# Broadvoice scandal exposes 350 million users

- What kind of attack was this?

  This form of cyber assault might potentially be classified as a SQL injection attack. It might also have been characterized as a basic attack if the attacker logged into the database and ran bespoke SQL statements without the website or application's given front end client or false authorization.

- How was this vulnerability discovered & how was it exploited?

  This leak was discovered by Bob Diachenko, a security consultant. The database configuration files had not been configured, or had been set incorrectly, allowing easy access to all of the company's information and requiring no authorization to access any information queries.

- What security measures could have been used to prevent this?

  Setting up and testing database access, as well as applying insights on questionable database activity, could have spotted and stopped this attack sooner. Even if information was leaked, having access to logs of who is accessing what information and with what authority might reveal trends in suspicious access and searches.

  Finally, the breach was discovered and the database configurations were successfully handled. It is unknown what information, if any, was exposed to an attacker, although it may have been as many as 350 million users. This could be used subsequently by attackers to invade users' privacy, utilized in identity theft and fraud, or saved for future phishing attempts with tailored information to the users.
